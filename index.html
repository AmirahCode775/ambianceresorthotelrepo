        <p>
            We sincerely thank you for your understanding.
            <br>
            Our website was recently the target of a cyber attack that led to unauthorized access.
            <br>
            We have successfully identified and removed the threat.
            <br>
            Thank you for your patience.
            Our website is currently undergoing emergency maintenance due to a recent unauthorized access incident. The
            issue
            has been identified and neutralized, and we are now implementing enhanced security measures to prevent any
            future
            disruptions.
            <br>
            Protecting our users is our top priority.
            We’re taking this time to reinforce our systems and ensure everything is fully secure before we return.
            <br>
            Please check back shortly — we’ll be back online soon, better than ever.
